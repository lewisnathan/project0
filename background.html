                    I was born in Whitecourt, AB where my father worked in forestry. Myself and my two younger brothers spent lots of time outdoors building tree forts,
                    riding our bikes, and going to the pool with our neighborhood friends. Our family was uprooted in the fall of 2012 when my parents decided to move to New Zealand
                    to travel and visit family. We lived in New Zealand for roughly 6 months, mostly travelling and experiencing the unique culture of New Zealand.

                    After moving back to Canada, my parents settled in Moose Jaw, SK to be closer to my fathers family. We lived on a farm roughly 30 minutes south of Moose
                    Jaw, close to my grandparents who farmed 2 miles down the road. My brothers and I helped out on the farm a little bit, but mostly enjoyed the wide open
                    outdoor spaces provided to us while living on an acreage. I went to high school in Moose Jaw and graduated in 2016 as valedictorian of my class. In the fall
                    of my graduating year, I moved to Calgary alongside a good friend of mine and dove head first into the engineering program. After 5 years of school, and a 
                    year long internship, I'm just about 3 months away from graduating wth my bachelors degree in Geomatics Engineering.
