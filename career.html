            As my time at the University of Calgary comes to an end, there are still many career's or career paths that interest me. I realize that my career path
            may change and that I still have many interests outside of the field of geomatics or even engineering.

            Coming from Saskatchewan, I've worked a little bit in the agriculture industry as a summer student and have worked as a surveyor across western Canada
            as part of my UofC internship program. I like to work outdoors and with my hands, so surveying seems like a natural fit for where I will begin my career.
            As part of my mental assessment of what I may do with my life, I've compiled a table of potential career paths for myself and a list of positives and negatives
            of working that particular job.
