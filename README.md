# project0

In this project, I wrote a short and simple website about myself (my background, interests, and career aspirations).

There are 4 html files included in this project:
  1. homepage.html - wrote a short introduction about myself, included a picture of myself, implemented a navigation bar (just using regular html/css styled unordered list),
                     and utilized a simple heading
  2. background.html - using bootstrap4's grid model and dropdown functions, wrote two short blurbs about my life separated into the six grid columns on the left and right
                     of the screen
  3. interests.html - included an unordered list about my interests and utilized scss nesting and inheritance to color the page
  4. career.html - wrote about my work experience and career aspirations and included a short table to visualize information
  5. style.css/style_vars.scss/style_vars.css - all of the styling for the progject is in these files!
