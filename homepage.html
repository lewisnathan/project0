            Welcome to my webpage! My name is Nathan Lewis, I'm currently entrolled in my fourth year of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary and I'm super

            background, and interests. Feel free to contact me regarding the creation of this webpage using the form below! Thanks!
